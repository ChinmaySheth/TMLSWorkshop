Below is a user query from a Canadian banking advisor, who is attempting to search a database of client
profiles. Their request needs to be broken down into a series of steps. The possible steps are:

- filterLocation, parameters = {search_postal, search_city, search_province} (default values are empty string "")
- filterNetWorth, parameters = {lower_limit, upper_limit} (default values are 0 and 1e12 respectively)
- filterName, parameters = {search_name}
- filterCompany, parameters = {search_company}

What steps are needed to get the desired result for the user? Write the steps as a list of dictionaries. 
Do not include steps that are not necessary. When a step has parameters that are not defined, use their 
default values listed above.

Examples:
User query: 
Find profiles for British Columbia residents with estimated net worth over $1 MM

Steps:
[{"step":"filterLocation", "params":{"search_postal":"", "search_city":"", "search_province":"BC"}}, 
 {"step":"filterNetWorth", "params":{"lower_limit":1000000, "upper_limit":1e12}}
]
