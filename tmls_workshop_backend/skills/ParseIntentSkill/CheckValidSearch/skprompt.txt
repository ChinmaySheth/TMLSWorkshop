Below is a user query from a Canadian banking client advisor, who is attempting to search a 
database of client profiles. The fields that are available to filter on are address (postal 
code, city, province/state), estimated net worth, name, and the company where the individuals 
work. If the user query involves only available fields, the query is valid. If the user query 
involves any fields that are not available for filtering (e.g. height, education level, 
salary), the query is invalid. 

The user may not refer to these fields by name, so infer their intention. There is no detailed
sub-information available on these fields (e.g. company is valid but tenure at the company is 
invalid; net worth is valid but specific asset types are invalid).

If a user is asking for information about a specific person, treat their request as a search
on that person's name. This would be a valid query.

Respond with "True" if the query is valid, or "False" if the query is invalid.
